                    <h1>How to thrive in a shifting market</h1>
                    <p>
                        With 2017 just around the corner, we must turn our attention to
                        marketing best practices for the new year. While the majority of
                        marketing changes don’t happen overnight, there are trends
                        emerging that will continue... to impact the new year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless you just got started in marketing, you already know that
                        content has reigned supreme for the past few years.
